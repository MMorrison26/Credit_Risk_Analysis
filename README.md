# Credit Risk Analysis
## Which Model Works Best

### *Overview*
At Fast Lending, they would like Jill and I to use Machine Learning to predict credit risk so they can identify good candidates and ultimately lower their default rates. We've obtained some data from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, to oversample, undersample, and look at a combinatorial approach versus two other Machine Learning models to see which model is best at predicting risk.
